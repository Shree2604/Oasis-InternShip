# 🌟 OasisInfoByte Internship Repository 🌟

Welcome to the OasisInfoByte Internship repository! 🚀 This repository serves as a documentation hub for my data science internship journey conducted at Oasis InfoByte in September. 📊🌐

## About the Internship 📅

During this internship, I embarked on an exciting journey in the field of data science, where I had the opportunity to work on three distinct tasks. These tasks encompassed various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. 🌿🔍 Here's an overview of the three tasks:

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification 🌸

The first task focused on the classification of iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements. The objective was to develop a robust model capable of distinguishing iris flower species. This task provided valuable insights into data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. 🌼📈

### Task 2: Email Spam Prediction 📧

The second task revolved around the challenging task of email spam prediction. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I developed a spam classification model to identify and filter out unwanted emails. This task delved into text analysis, feature engineering, and classification techniques. 📬🤖

### Task 3: Sales Prediction 📈

In the third task, I ventured into the world of sales prediction. Using historical sales data, I built a predictive model to forecast future sales trends. This task highlighted the importance of time series analysis, feature selection, and regression modeling. 📉💼

## Repository Contents 📂
